A full explanation of Khrushchev’s speech and its aftermath and of the social processes surrounding the history and memory of Stalinist collective violence requires the articulation of novel theoretical positions. Analyses of legacies of mass historical violence in Europe and elsewhere typically cast the social arena as a battleground between memory and oblivion, projecting psychic mechanisms associated with the aftermath of trauma—most frequently those of repression and repetition compulsion—as metaphors for collective processes in which a society as a whole is conceived as repressing memory of past events, memory that must be brought to the fore if recovery and amelioration are to take place. Yet memory, forgetting, and repression are precisely the wrong terms for analysis of legacies of Stalinist mass violence in the USSR—and in present-day Russia as well. In this case, nothing is forgotten, and repression—with wooden clubs or exile to the camps—bears little resemblance to repression of traumatic suffering, in which the original perception of unimaginable events is thought to remain unassimilated by memory, an inaccessible lost experience.",5073,1,3,2,1,1,1,2,3,3,1.888888889,0.0041119591,0.5925925927,NEG,2.66666666666667,0,12,0,0.248098633392751,1.82735751295337,NEG,19,0.067357512953368,0,0.072538860103627,0,33,24,0,0,0,0,1,47,4,0,13,0,1,1,6,0,1,0,0,0.005181347150259,0.025906735751295,0,0.72,0.005181347150259,5,0,3,2,4,7,2,5,3,0,0,0,0

Crucially, the Duchess does not choose to make a world of philosophy or of abstracted forms, symbols, or ideas like the models she rejects, but instead a world of anthropomorphized matter, a foundational quality that renders humans and nature of the same cloth. As with all science fiction, the fantastical worlds constructed in one’s imagination only become coherent when expressed in fragments of common knowledge: Huxley’s flying cars in Brave New World are cars nevertheless, just like the purplish complexions of the beast-men in the Blazing World are only comprehensible to the Empress in terms of the skin colors of her native world. That the semiotics of science fiction works this way is not new; but that Cavendish chooses anthropomorphism in The Blazing World (and in Observations) as a distinct method for acknowledging and describing the ways in which nature is already animated is highly relevant to our contemporary studies of both the Anthropocene and Cavendish. Though one of the most formidable challenges for natural philosophers in Cavendish’s early modern England was to systematize experimentation such that experimental science could more reliably earn Sprat’s rhetorical claim to “Real Knowledge,” perhaps one of the most formidable challenges of the Anthropocene age is to rethink the kind of “Real Knowledge” that positions nature as an inanimate object in relation to the human subject, and thus to learn how to articulate our world as animated with us, not in opposition to us.",3025,1,3,2,2,1,2,2,2,3,2,0.012,0.222222222,NEG,7.88888888888889,0.017301038062284,14,3,0.202057594358104,1.86854671280277,NEG,31,0.069204152249135,0,0.065743944636678,0,46,34,0,0,1,0,1,43,19,0,21,0,5,7,15,1,2,0,1,0.01038062283737,0.041522491349481,0,0.52,0,12,0,8,2,3,2,3,11,4,0,2,8,4

NEG,ABSTRACT,ACADEMIC-SCIENCE_5S_120.txt,"Solvation thermodynamics is concerned with the evaluation and physical interpretation of solvation free energies. Endpoints DFT provides a framework for computing solvation free energies by combining molecular simulations with a version of the classical density-functional theory of solutions which focuses on., the indirect (solvent-mediated) part of the solute-solvent potential of mean force (indirect PMF). The simulations are performed at the endpoints of a hypothetical charging process which transforms the solvent density from the pure liquid state to that of the solution state. The endpoints DFT expression for solvation free energy can be shown to be equivalent to the standard expression for which the key quantity is the direct correlation function, but it has the advantage that the indirect term. is more focused on the change in solvent-solvent correlations with respect to the pure liquid as the solute is inserted into the solution. In this Perspective, we review recent developments of endpoints DFT, highlighting a series of papers we have written together beginning in 2017. We emphasize the importance of dimensionality reduction as the key to the evaluation of endpoints DFT expressions and present a recently developed, spatially resolved version of the theory. The role of interfacial water at certain positions which stabilize or destabilize a solute in solution can be analyzed with the spatially resolved version, and it is of considerable interest to investigate how changes in solvation affect protein-ligand binding and conformational landscapes from an endpoints DFT perspective. Endpoints DFT can also be employed in materials science; an example involving the rational design strategy for polymer membrane separation is described. The endpoints DFT method is a scheme to evaluate the solvation free energy by introducing approximations to integrate the classical density functional over a charging parameter. We have further proposed a new functional which captures the correct dependence of the indirect PMF. at both endpoints of the charging process, and we review how it might be employed in future work.",2059,2,1,1,2,3,1,1,2,2,1.666666667,0.026,0.2222222223,NEG,2.13333333333333,0.015576323987539,7,1,0.146912722848552,1.77342679127726,NEG,46,0.102803738317757,0,0.087227414330218,0,44,37,0,0,2,0,4,69,6,0,24,0,0,8,6,1,0,0,2,0.015576323987539,0.012461059190031,0,0.465116279069767,0.018691588785047,8,0,9,0,9,14,9,12,5,0,2,0,0

Moreover, its phosphorylated protein (P-CaMKII) is involved in memory, mood, and pain regulation in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Electroacupuncture (EA) is a traditional Chinese therapeutic technique that can effectively treat chronic inflammatory pain. However, the CaMKII-GluA1 role in EA analgesia in the ACC remains unclear. This study investigated the role of P-CaMKII and P-GluA1 in a mouse model of inflammatory pain induced by complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA). There were increased P-CaMKII and P-GluA1 levels in the ACC. We found that intracerebroventricular injection of KN93, a CaMKII inhibitor, as well as EA stimulation, attenuated complete Freund's adjuvant-induced pain behavior. Further, EA increased pCaMKII-PICK1 complex (abbreviated as C-P complex) levels. Our findings demonstrate that EA inhibits inflammatory pain by inhibiting CaMKII-GluA1 phosphorylation.

NEG,ABSTRACT,ACADEMIC-SCIENCE_5S_13.txt,"Many studies, experimental, theoretical, and numerical, have been done on polymer nanocomposites, but nearly all of them have focused on a particular type of material system or some specific material properties. A comprehensive understanding of this complicated material system is still quite lacking. The objective of this study is to use mesoscale finite element simulation to gain insights on the reinforcing efficiencies of different types of carbon nanofillers as distinguished by their geometries and interfacial strengths. It is demonstrated that CNT (carbon nanotube) and CNF (carbon nanofiber) have larger load carrying capacity and potentially higher reinforcing efficiency than GNP (graphite nanoplatelet) due to their larger aspect ratio and physical length. However, the higher load carrying capacity is also associated with higher interfacial stress which can lead to earlier debonding, particularly for CNT. GNP, on the other hand, has lower load carrying capacity, and is thus less sensitive to the bonding condition and less susceptible to debonding. The overall reinforcing efficiency is a manifestation of the interplay between the load carrying capacity of the filler, which is limited by filler's geometry, and the load transfer capability at the interface, which is limited by the filler/matrix interfacial strength. This interplay is also reflected in the effects of filler orientation on reinforcing efficiency. The insights gained from this study can be used to devise a strategy for developing advanced nanocomposites, such as hybrid composites.",3050,1,4,2,1,1,1,1,2,1,1.555555556,0.008,0.5185185187,NEG,5.66666666666667,0,10,0,0.195285858908781,1.92344827586207,NEG,24,0.09051724137931,0,0.064655172413793,0,28,23,8,0,3,0,2,56,4,0,13,0,1,4,9,1,0,0,3,0,0.051724137931035,0,0.590909090909091,0,7,0,5,1,10,10,3,10,3,0,0,0,0

NEG,ABSTRACT,ACADEMIC-SCIENCE_5S_157.txt,"Objective Few studies have examined lockdown effects on the way of living and well-being of older adults stratified by cognitive state. Since cognitive deficits are common in this population, we investigated how cognition influenced their understanding of the pandemic, socio-behavioral responses and lifestyle adaptations during lockdown, and how these factors affected their mood or memory. Method Telephone-based survey involving 204 older adults >= 65 y/o (median: 82) with previous assessments of cognitive state: 164 normal-old (NOLD), 24 mild-neurocognitive disorder (mild-NCD), 18 mild-moderate dementia. A structured questionnaire was developed to assess psychological and socio-behavioral variables. Logistic regression was used to ascertain their effects on mood and memory. Results With increasing cognitive deficits, understanding of the pandemic and the ability to follow lockdown policies, adapt to lifestyle changes, and maintain remote interactions decreased. Participants with dementia were more depressed; NOLDs remained physically and mentally active but were more bored and anxious. Sleeping and health problems independently increased the likelihood of depression (OR: 2.29; CI: 1.06-4.93; p = 0.034 and OR: 2.45; CI: 1.16-5.16; p = 0.018, respectively); Regular exercise was protective (OR: 0.30; CI: 0.12-0.72; p = 0.007). Worsening subjective memory complaints were associated with dementia (p = 0.006) and depression (p = 0.004); New-onset sleeping problems raised their odds (OR: 10.26; CI: 1.13-93.41; p = 0.039). Finally, >40% with health problems avoided healthcare mainly due to fear of contagion.

The role of LACTB in PINO treatment was investigated by transfection of siRNA-LACTB. Cell counting kit-8 assay, wound healing assay, and Transwell assay were conducted to evaluate the proliferation, migration, and invasiveness of CRC cells, respectively. Western blot or quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was carried out to measure the expressions of LACTB, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, E-cadherin, and N-cadherin. Results: Gradient PINO inhibited the viability, migration, invasiveness, and expressions of MMP-2 and N-cadherin in CRC cells, while promoted E-cadherin and LACTB expressions. Silencing LACTB promoted the viability, migration, invasiveness, and expressions of MMP-2 and N-cadherin in CRC cells and inhibited E-cadherin expression.

NEG,ABSTRACT,ACADEMIC-SCIENCE_5S_341.txt,"The effects of cold plasma on the enzymatic activity, color, bioactive compounds, and antioxidant activity of avocado pulp with lime extract (PL) and without extract (PW) were studied. The experimental conditions applied varied with regard to time (10, 20, and 30 min) and gas flow (10, 20, and 30 ml). The gas flow combination of 20 ml/20 min applied in PL was efficient for reducing POD and PPO activities and browning index as well as for color maintenance. Cold plasma increased the phenolic and carotenoid levels in PW in T1 and T2 (gas flow 10 ml/10-30 min) and in PL in T3 and T8 (gas flow 30 ml/10 min and 20 ml/30 min), which contributed to the improvement in antioxidant activity. The phenolic showed a strong correlation with ORAC-H in PL (0.85) and PW (0.75). Myristic and palmitic acid were reduced after applying cold plasma, however, oleic, linoleic, and linolenic increased the content. It is concluded that the synergistic effect of lime extract in avocado pulp with cold plasma technology is efficient at maintaining the quality characteristics and improving the bioactive content. Practical applications Cold plasma processing is an alternative method of effective maintenance for enzyme control, and it also shows promising results in the conservation of chemical quality and in increasing the levels of bioactive compounds and increasing the antioxidant capacity in fruit products, such as avocado pulp.

NEG,ABSTRACT,ACADEMIC-SCIENCE_5S_43.txt,"Background: The recent widespread availability of augmented reality via smartphone offers an opportunity to translate cue exposure therapy for smoking cessation from the laboratory to the real world. Despite significant reductions in the smoking rates in the last decade, approximately 13.7% of the adults in the United States continue to smoke. Smoking-related cue exposure has demonstrated promise as an adjuvant therapy in the laboratory, but practical limitations have prevented its success in the real world. Augmented reality technology presents an innovative approach to overcome these limitations. Objective: The aim of this study was to develop a smartphone app that presents smoking-related augmented reality images for cue exposure. Smokers provided feedback on the images and reported on the perceived urge to smoke, qualities of reality/coexistence, and general feedback about quality and functioning. The feedback was used to refine the augmented reality images within the app. Methods: In collaboration with an augmented reality design company, we developed 6 smoking-related images (cigarette, lighter, ashtray, lit cigarette in ashtray, etc) and 6 neutral images similar in size or complexity for comparison (pen, eraser, notebook, soda bottle with droplets, etc). Ten smokers completed a survey of demographic characteristics, smoking history and behavior, dependence on nicotine, motivation to quit smoking, and familiarity with augmented reality technology. Then, participants viewed each augmented reality image and provided ratings on 10-point Likert scales for urge to smoke and reality/coexistence of the image into the scene. Participants were also queried with open-ended questions regarding the features of the images. Results: Of the 10 participants, 5 (50%) had experienced augmented reality prior to the laboratory visit, but only 4 of those 5 participants used augmented reality at least weekly. Although the sample was small (N=10), smokers reported significantly higher urge to smoke after viewing the smoking-related augmented reality images (median 4.58, SD 3.49) versus the neutral images (median 1.42, SD 3.01) (Z=-2.14, P=.03; d=0.70). The average reality and coexistence ratings of the images did not differ between smoking-related and neutral images (all P>.29). Augmented reality images were found on average to be realistic (mean [SD] score 6.49 [3.11]) and have good environmental coexistence (mean [SD] score 6.93 [3.04]) and user coexistence (mean [SD] score 6.38 [3.27]) on the 10-point scale. Participant interviews revealed some areas of excellence (eg, details of the lit cigarette) and areas for improvement (eg, stability of images, lighting). Conclusions: All images were generally perceived as being realistic and well-integrated into the environment.

Our research questions were: (1) What conditions did educators identify in the PLN overall that supported their co-construction of knowledge and practice development together? and (2) How did including co-teaching partners in the PLN help participants to mobilize knowledge and/or practices in the contexts where they were working? Design/methodology/approach A qualitative case study design was used because of its potential to examine how and why questions about complex processes as situated in context (Butler, 2011; Yin, 2014). A case study methodology allowed us to collect and coordinate multiple forms of evidence (i.e. interviews, teacher reflective writing, classroom artifacts, field notes) to examine both how conditions created within the PLN supported learning and how co-teaching partners were mobilizing what they were learning in their school contexts. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and data was analyzed abductively through an iterative and recursive process (Braun et al., 2018). Findings Conditions within the PLN overall that participants identified as supportive to their knowledge mobilization and practice development included: having a shared focus, feeling accountability to the group, collaborative enactment of practices within the PLN, large group sharing and debriefing, sustained cycles of collaborative inquiry, affective support, valuing diversity and drawing from expert others as resources. Participants also identified the benefits that accrued specifically from working with co-teaching partners. In addition, findings showed how the degree to which partners engaged in rich forms of collaborative inquiry could be related to their learning and situated practice development. Originality/value Findings show the generative potential of inviting co-teaching partners into a PLN to engage in collaborative inquiry with others. PLNs offer the benefit of engaging with educators from outside of one's practice context, which enables pushing their thinking in new directions. Our findings add to the literature by revealing how in situ knowledge mobilization can be amplified when educators participating within a PLN are also working through cycles of inquiry with a co-teaching partner. Overall, this study offers a PLN model where teachers have built-in support for knowledge co-creation and mobilization both within and outside of their school contexts.",2044,1,2,1,2,2,2,1,4,2,1.888888889,0.234,0.3703703703,NEG,3.61538461538462,0.034666666666667,18,4,0.121535480256371,1.70168,NEG,22,0.122666666666667,0,0.072,5,48,31,0,0,5,2,3,72,10,0,47,0,2,13,6,0,0,1,5,0.008,0.029333333333333,0,0.597560975609756,0.008,11,0,11,18,19,10,5,2,5,1,10,0,0
NEG,ABSTRACT,ACADEMIC-SCIENCE_5S_449.txt,"The monitoring of Aedes urban species is usually conducted by ovitraps, which can provide a good estimate of population density at low cost and relatively easy management. When the monitoring network is managed by many operators, as in the case of the Emilia-Romagna regional plan, it becomes necessary to develop a quality control methodology capable of highlighting the possible data incoherency and ensuring that the monitoring system provides reliable data. This paper presents the procedure applied in the egg counting phase as developed in Emilia-Romagna in order to check the data quality and validate the data before being included in the database. Several steps have been identified and protocols developed to serve quality control such as training of technicians and intralaboratory quality check, daily random double counting of Masonite paddles and interlaboratory periodic comparison. The qualitative test showed that all operators were able to distinguish Aedes albopictus eggs from other mosquito species eggs. The quantitative test showed significant differences between the 11 operators, with a relative error resulting in the range of 0.1-25.8%. The daily internal double counting of randomly extracted Masonite slides was performed by the coordinator showing a relative error in the range 2.47-2.63% without statistical differences, confirming a good alignment of the operators with the coordinator throughout the monitoring period. The interlaboratory comparison trial produced an average relative error of 7.20% showing a sufficient alignment between the three laboratories.

NEG,ABSTRACT,ACADEMIC-SCIENCE_5S_558.txt,"Aims/Introduction Tubulointerstitial fibrosis is a hallmark of diabetic nephropathy and is associated with an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) program and aberrant glycolysis. Dimeric pyruvate kinase (PK) M2 (PKM2) acts as a key protein kinase in aberrant glycolysis by promoting the accumulation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1 alpha, while tetrameric PKM2 functions as a pyruvate kinase in oxidative phosphorylation. The aim of the research is to study the effect of PKM2 tetramer activation on preventing kidney fibrosis via suppression of aberrant glycolysis and the EMT program. Materials and methods In vivo: Streptozotocin (STZ) was utilized to induce diabetes in 8-week-old CD-1 mice; 4 weeks after diabetes induction, proteinuria-induced kidney fibrosis was developed by intraperitoneal injection of bovine serum albumin (BSA: 0.3 g/30 g BW) for 14 days; The PKM2 activator TEPP-46 was also administered orally simultaneously. In vitro: HK2 cells were co-treated with high-glucose media or/and TGF-beta 1 and TEPP46 for 48 h, cellular protein was extracted for evaluation. Results Diabetic mice developed kidney fibrosis associated with aberrant glycolysis and EMT; BSA injection accelerated kidney fibrosis in both the control and diabetic mice; TEPP-46 rescued the kidney fibrosis. In HK2 cells, TEPP-46 suppressed the EMT program induced by TGF-beta 1 and/or high-glucose incubation. TEPP-46-induced PKM2 tetramer formation and PK activity resulted in suppression of HIF-1 alpha and lactate accumulation. Specific siRNA-mediated knockdown of HIF-1 alpha expression diminished high glucose-induced mesenchymal protein levels. Conclusion PKM2 activation could restore the tubular phenotype via suppression of the EMT program and aberrant glycolysis, providing an alternative target to mitigate fibrosis in diabetic kidneys.",5054,1,3,1,1,2,1,1,1,1,1.333333333,0.016,0.2222222223,NEG,4.15384615384615,0.003891050583658,12,8,0.091304713804714,1.45338521400778,NEG,16,0.077821011673152,0,0.035019455252918,4,32,30,0,0,6,0,1,102,2,1,13,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,6,0.003891050583658,0.003891050583658,0,0.736842105263158,0.019455252918288,3,0,4,11,3,8,0,4,0,0,0,0,0
NEG,ABSTRACT,ACADEMIC-SCIENCE_5S_574.txt,"MicroRNA (miR)-141-3p, which functions as an oncogene in multiple malignancies, has been shown to be highly overexpressed in esophageal cancer cells in our previous work. miR-141-3p is predicted to bind the messenger RNA (mRNA) of tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (TSC1), a tumor suppressor, with high affinity. In this study, we investigated the expression and functional interaction between miR-141-3p and TSC1 in esophageal cancer cells. Experiments were conducted in four esophageal cancer lines and in tumor cells isolated from human esophageal cancer specimens by laser capture microdissection. miR-141-3p expression was measured by real time and droplet digital PCR. Biotinylated RNA pull-down and luciferase reporter assays were used to assess binding. miR-141-3p function was tested by assessing proliferation, migration, invasion, and induction of autophagy following its silencing. We found that miR-141-3p levels were increased in TE7, OE33, and TE10 esophageal cancer cells compared to FLO-1 cells, with similar heterogeneity observed in human esophageal cancer specimens. Silencing of miR-141-3p led to increased TSC1 protein expression in these cells and was associated with increased TSC1 translation. Binding studies reveal that miR-141-3p binds to each of the predicted binding sites in the 3 '-untranslated region of TSC1 mRNA. Following miR-141-3p silencing, TE7, OE33, and TE10 cells exhibited decreased proliferation, migration, and invasion, as well as enhanced autophagy. Importantly, these phenotypic effects were replicated by overexpression of TSC1 alone in these cells.

Entry of FA into the human body can have adverse effects on human health, depending on the FA concentration. Thus, a quantitative analysis of FA in blood is necessary in order to estimate its effect on the human body. In this study, a simple and rapid analytical method for the quantitation of FA in blood was developed. The total analysis time, including the pretreatment procedure, was less than 20 min. To ensure a stable analysis, blood samples were stabilized using tripotassium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid solution, and FA was selectively derivatized using 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine as pretreatment procedures. The pretreated samples were analyzed using a high-performance liquid chromatography-UV system, which is the most common choice for analyzing small-molecule aldehydes like formaldehyde.

Methods: The patients with severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count <50 x 10(9)/L) following transcatheter occlusion of a PDA from January 2010 to December 2018 in the Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University were collected. And the high-risk factors, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of severe thrombocytopenia were analyzed. Results: A total of 1,581 children with transcatheter occlusion of a PDA were collected; 22 (1.39%) of the enrolled patients had severe thrombocytopenia. Further data analysis showed that the median diameter of PDA (6.7 [IQR: 1.63]) mm in children with severe thrombocytopenia was significantly larger than that in children without severe thrombocytopenia (3.6 +/- 1.7 mm, p < 0.001). Furthermore, the incidence of thrombocytopenia in children with residual shunt after operation (10.9%) was significantly higher than that in children without residual shunt (0.2%, p < 0.001). The mean time of thrombocytopenia was found to be 2.4 +/- 1.3 days after intervention. All patients with thrombocytopenia were treated by methylprednisolone with or without platelet transfusion and recovered without major organ hemorrhage. Conclusions: Severe thrombocytopenia following transcatheter occlusion of a PDA may be related to the larger diameter of PDA and residual shunt.

This survey's foremost objective is to find the optimum attack angle for the highest heat transfer performance in the studied geometry. The attained results demonstrated that the Rayleigh number's augmentation leads to buoyancy force amplification and intensification of velocity components in the enclosure. Hence, the shapes of streamlines for each attack angle are different from the other states. The enhancement of the Rayleigh number causes better temperature distribution between cold and hot sources. The attack angle changes are the other factor for creating and intensity of the temperature gradients. By increasing the attack angle when the heat is transferred from the hot source to the top of the enclosure, the thermal distribution effects come with high gradients due to the flow balance disturbance and the changes in two sources' location. As the fluid moves, velocity components always change. In Rayleigh number of Ra = 1 x 10(3) due to a decrease of buoyancy force and negligible density changes in the enclosure, the average friction coefficient (C-fave) is not considerable, and for everyone studied attack angles, these changes are negligible.

Results Culex pipiens biotype molestus mosquitoes originating from Germany and the Republic of Serbia and Cx. torrentium mosquitoes from Germany proved competent for USUV, as indicated by harboring viable virus in their saliva 21 days post infection. By contrast, Ae. aegypti mosquitoes were relatively refractory to an USUV infection, exhibiting low infection rates and lacking virus in their saliva. Conclusions Consistent with the high prevalences and abundances of Cx. pipiens biotype molestus and Cx. torrentium in Central and Northern Europe, these two species have most likely played a historic role in the spread, maintenance, and introduction of USUV into Germany. Identification of the key USUV vectors enables the establishment and implementation of rigorous entomological surveillance programs and the development of effective, evidence-based vector control interventions.",4027,2,4,2,2,3,1,1,3,2,2.222222222,0.034,0.2962962963,NEG,4.57142857142857,0.010238907849829,16,6,0.052746720697849,1.64597269624573,NEG,24,0.054607508532423,0,0.044368600682594,2,38,46,0,0,4,0,0,61,14,0,35,0,0,3,6,0,1,0,4,0.003412969283276,0.054607508532423,0,0.863636363636364,0.023890784982935,7,0,2,7,6,11,3,4,1,0,0,4,2
NEG,ABSTRACT,ACADEMIC-SCIENCE_5S_938.txt,"Italy was one of the countries most affected by the number of people infected and dead during the first COVID-19 wave. The authors describe the rapid rollout of a population health clinical and organizational response in preparedness and capabilities to support the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Italian province of Modena. The authors review the processes, the challenges faced, and describe how excess demand for hospital services was successfully mitigated and thus overwhelming the healthcare services avoided the collapse of the local health care system. An analysis of bed occupancy in the region predicted during the first weeks of the epidemic. The SEIR model estimated the number of infected people under different containment measures. Community resources were mobilized to reduce provincial hospitals' burden of care. A population health approach, based on a radical reorganization of the workflow and emergency patient management, was implemented. The bed saturation of the Modena Healthcare Agency was measured by an ad hoc, newly implemented intensive care unit (ICU) bed occupancy and COVID-19 centralized governance dashboard. ICU bed occupancy increased by 114%, avoiding saturation of the Modena Healthcare Agency system. The Emilia-Romagna region achieved a higher rate of ICU bed availability at 2.15 ICU beds per 10,000 inhabitants as compared with community 1 ICU bed availability prior to the pandemic. Rapid and radical local reorganization of regional efforts helped inform the successful development and implementation of strategic choices within the hospital and the community to prevent the saturation of key facilities.",5072,2,4,3,2,3,4,2,4,3,3,0.216,0,NEG,3.41666666666667,0.008064516129032,10,5,0.121193514088251,1.965,NEG,35,0.092741935483871,0,0.036290322580645,1,33,25,1,0,1,0,0,70,11,0,19,0,1,0,4,0,1,0,1,0.024193548387097,0.100806451612903,0,0.795454545454545,0.012096774193548,4,0,4,11,1,10,3,0,0,0,1,0,0

Russian liberal nationalists and pan-Slavs were likely to favour a forward policy on the Turkish Straits and a posture of solidarity with the Slavic ‘little brothers’ on the Balkan peninsula. Conservatives, by contrast, tended to be acutely aware of Russia’s inner political and financial weakness and the dangers – as Kokovtsov put it – of pursuing ‘an active foreign policy at the expense of the peasant’s stomach’; they therefore favoured a policy of peace at all costs.49

When the significance of the Bosnian annexation crisis was debated in the Duma in the spring of 1909, for example, the conservative interests represented in the Council of the United Nobility argued that the annexation had in no way damaged Russian interests or security and that Russia should adopt a policy of complete non-interference in Balkan affairs, while seeking reconciliation with Berlin. The real enemy, they argued, was Britain, which was trying to push Russia into a war with Germany in order to consolidate British control of world markets. Against this position, the pro-French and pro-British liberals of the Constitutional Democrat (Cadet) Party called for the transformation of the Triple Entente into a Triple Alliance that would enable Russia to project power in the Balkan region and arrest the decline of its great power status.50 This was one of the central problems confronting all the foreign policy executives (and those who try to understand them today): the ‘national interest’ was not an objective imperative pressing in upon government from the world outside, but the projection of particular interests within the political elite itself.51
